\chapter{Conclusions}
% This final chapter is used to recap what you did in the project. No detail, just a high-level summary of your project (1 page or a bit less is usually enough, but it depends on the specific project).
In this paper, the motivations and advantages in safety-oriented applications of PUFs were initially discussed. Different types of PUFs were then presented, selecting one of them to be implemented, and giving the minimum knowledge to understand and to follow the project.
Afterward, it was discussed how the project was developed, from the research phase to the actual development, providing an high-level view of the chosen implementation.
In addition, implementation details were also provided in order to understand the code and improve it.
In the last chapter, the results were discussed along with their limitations. Finally, the possible future improvements were highlighted.
